<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">Given two&nbsp;strings X and Y&nbsp;of lengths&nbsp;m and n&nbsp;respectively, find the length of the smallest string which has both, X and Y as its sub-sequences.<br>
Note:&nbsp;X&nbsp;and Y can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>X = abcd, Y = xycd
<strong>Output: </strong>6<strong>
Explanation: </strong>Shortest Common Supersequence
would be abxycd which is of length 6 and
has both the strings as its subsequences.</span>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>X = efgh, Y = jghi
<strong>Output: </strong>6<strong>
Explanation: </strong>Shortest Common Supersequence
would be ejfghi which is of length 6 and
has both the strings as its subsequences.</span></pre>
